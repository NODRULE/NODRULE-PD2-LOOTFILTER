NODRULE Lootfilter for PD2

( DOWNLOAD FILE ----> https://github.com/NODRULE/NODRULE-PD2-LOOTFILTER/archive/main.zip )

1. Find your Project Diablo 2 folder. It should have been installed within your Diablo 2 folder(blizzard original install folder) and the folder will be named "ProjectD2".

(Optional) If you already configured a filter, back it up now by renaming/copying your filter. Your filter name would probably be loot.filter or default.filter.

2. To install any new filter, copy the filter to the ProjectD2 folder (backup old filter if you want) and name the new loot filter you have downloaded to (without quotes): "loot.filter". Make sure you have no .txt at the end of the file name. Sometime windows hides the .txt extensions of files. If you have a .txt at the end of the file, it can and will cause your filter to not work.

3. If you have not already, in order to enable the loot filter, go inside of a game and then "control + left click" the small settings button in the bottom left of your screen once you have created a game within PD2.

4. In the new window, you need to check the box next to Advanced item display.
